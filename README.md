Mission : To bridge the gap between theory and motion — DriftBot-AI simulates aerodynamic behavior in cars using physics-based equations, and evolves into an AI system that learns to optimize drag, downforce, and stability across speed regimes.

Core Features:

🧠 Physics-Based Simulation:
Calculates aerodynamic drag and lift/downforce from fundamental fluid dynamics equations.

⚙️ Smart Inputs:
Customize parameters like airspeed, frontal area, and drag/lift coefficients.

📊 Dynamic Visuals:
Real-time plots for velocity vs. drag/downforce using Matplotlib.

🤖 AI Evolution (Next Phase):
Integrating ML models (via scikit-learn) to predict and suggest optimal aerodynamic setups.

🌐 Web Interface:
Flask-based UI for intuitive simulations.
